<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>Hello there! My name is Diego Zanon and I&#39;m a computer engineer. If you want to know more about what I&#39;ve done and what I like, you can visit my profile page at <a href="https://diego.zanon.io">diego.zanon.io</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-i-blog-">What will I blog?</h2>
<p>I&#39;m a Full-Stack developer that loves JavaScript, MongoDB and AWS. That&#39;s where I&#39;ll focus here.</p>
<p>I intend to follow 2 rules while blogging here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never blog about something that is trivial or widely known, otherwise I&#39;ll not be contributing to add useful info.</li>
<li><p>Blog about things that I don&#39;t know so much and where I must pretend to be an expert. That&#39;s the best way to learn more!</p>
<p>Please, correct me in comments (Disqus) if you see something wrong and I&#39;ll be grateful.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-am-i-blogging-">Why am I blogging?</h2>
<p>Learning new things is nice and important, but if I don&#39;t write down what I learn, it&#39;ll vanish from my memory much faster.</p>
<p>But, why do I need to share what I&#39;m learning? I&#39;m shy and don&#39;t like public exposition. The reason is that I&#39;ve read a post some months ago and that changed my vision: <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-do-the-top-1-of-software-engineers-do-that-the-other-99-do-not">What do the top 1% of software engineers do that the other 99% do not?</a> (specially Michael O. Church&#39;s answer).</p>
<p>Michael&#39;s post tries to quantify the knowledge in software engineering and the conclusion is that smart people shares. There are &quot;Adders&quot;, who only &quot;add&quot; new code to the world and the &quot;Multipliers&quot;, people who share and can make a difference in a larger scale. I want to be in the second group.</p>
<p>Also, most of the tools that I use are free and open-source and the places where I use to learn (blogs, Stack Overflow, etc) offers everything for free. It&#39;s the good will of people that keeps me learning for free so my way to give it back is to share what I learn and build.</p>
